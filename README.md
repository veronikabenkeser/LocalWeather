<h1>Local Weather App</h1>
This project was built as a part of Free Code Camp's Intermediate Front-End Development curriculum.

<h2>User stories</h2>

1. As a user, I can see the weather in my current location. 
2. As a user, I can see an icon depending on the temperature. 
3. As a user, I see a different background image depending on the temperature (e.g. snowy mountains, hot desert). 
4. As a user, I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
